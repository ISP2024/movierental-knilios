## Movie Rental Refactoring

A classic refactoring problem from Chapter 1 of
_Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_ by Martin Fowler.  

This repository contains Python code translated from the Java version.

The runnable `main.py` creates a customer and prints a statement.


## Instructions

See [Movie Rental Refactoring, Part 1](https://cpske.github.io/ISP/assignment/movierental/movierental-part1) for description of the code and what to do.

Before and after each refactoring you should **run the unit tests**.

## Resources

See [Resources](https://cpske.github.io/ISP/assignment/movierental/movierental-part1#resources) in the assignment description.

## Rationale
2.1 It has the Feature Envy smell. The field is used in the Rental class more then the Movie class.
2.2 It violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The movie had more the one responsibility which is to contain the information about the movie and contain the price (Which can change depending on how long it has been released.)
